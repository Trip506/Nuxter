				<v-card-text>Morocco wants to build solar plants specifically for export to Europe. However, Morocco's own power supply is to be covered by two gigantic coal-fired power plants in the north of the country, with one power station already completed and another in plan . The coal for this is imported by ship to Morocco. The Safi Power Station is so large that it alone covers 25% of the country's energy needs. This is a lucrative business model for the Moroccan Kingdom. The flow of coal is very cheap for Morocco, since the African country, unlike EU member states, does not have to pay a CO2-tax to the EU.</v-card-text>
				<v-card-text>
					<b>In essence, Spain and France are outsourcing dirty coal fired energy production to countries with less environmental laws and regulations</b>

					EU directive is that by 2020 each member state in its total balance at least 20% of electricity from renewable energy sources.
					This is a problem especially in France, whose energy supply consists of more than 70% of nuclear power. In order to reach the 20% mark on time, France has an interest in importing green electricity from Spain and profitably exporting the superfluous nuclear power. The target total balance of 20% green electricity is thus achieved - at least on paper.

				<v-card-text>
					<b>Not only does Morocco and France benefit from the export of green electricity, but above all the REE company - from the supply of the necessary electricity grids.</b>
